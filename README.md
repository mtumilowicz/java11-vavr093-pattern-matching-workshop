# project description

# theory in a nutshell
* easy example to set intuition
    ```
    String s = Match(i).of(
        Case($(1), "one"),
        Case($(2), "two"),
        Case($(), "?")
    );
    ```
    and a lazy equivalent with functions
    ```
     String s = Match(i).of(
         Case($(1), number -> "one"),
         Case($(2), number -> "two"),
         Case($(), number -> "?")
     );
    ```
* `Case` consists of two parts:
    * part that matches logic: `$(1)`
    * part that says what should be returned when value matches. 
        * it can be any object 
        * it can be supplier of an object
        * it can be function of a matched value
* saves us from writing stacks of if-then-else branches
* switch-case on steroids
* is not natively supported in Java - we need third party libraries
* more human readable way
* reduces the amount of code while focusing on the relevant parts
* patterns overview
    * `$()` - wildcard pattern
        * saves us from a `MatchError` which is thrown if no case matches
    * `$(value)` - equals pattern
    * `$(predicate)` - conditional pattern
* in most cases it acts like an expression, it results in a value, but there is a
possibility to handle side effects as well (well-known `Void` hack)
* a constructor is a function which is applied to arguments and returns a new instance, 
a deconstructor is a function which takes an instance and returns the parts (object is unapplied)
* the easies to see is deconstructor used on LocalDate to get year, month and day
    ```
    return Match(date).of(
            Case($LocalDate($(2019), $(), $()), _2019 -> ...),
            Case($LocalDate($(2018), $(), $()), _2018 -> ...),
            Case($LocalDate($(2017), $(), $()), _2017 -> ...)
    );
    ```
* Match is type-safe - Case($LocalDate($("2019"), $(), $()), _2019 -> ...) // compile error
* structural pattern matching allows us to deconstruct object hierarchies
* When the project is compiled, the Patterns are automatically generated by vavr's annotation processor 
and stored in build/generated/sources/annotationProcessor
# conclusions in a nutshell
* as we cannot perform exhaustiveness checks (feature not supporter on the language level), 
there is possibility to return an `Option` result which prevents as from `MatchError`:
    ```
    Match(obj).option(
         Case($(predicate1()), do something));
         Case($(predicate2()), do something else));
    ```
    and in the case when there is no much for `predicate1()` as well as `predicate2()`
    we got `Option.none()` instead of `MatchError`
* predicates - list
* Object Decomposition
    * annotation preprocessor
* predefined patterns
* User-Defined Patterns
* run, side effects
    * run must not be used as direct return value, i.e. outside of a lambda body
    the Cases will be eagerly evaluated before the patterns are matched
